## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **Rust** (latest stable version)
- **Deepgram API Key** (free tier available at https://console.deepgram.com/signup)

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vasanthV127/wispr-clone.git
cd wispr-clone
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Deepgram API Key

1. Sign up for a free Deepgram account at https://console.deepgram.com/signup
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Edit `.env` and add your Deepgram API key:

```
VITE_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 4. Run the Application

#### Development Mode (Recommended)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:1420/ in your browser

#### Desktop App (Requires Visual C++ Build Tools)

```bash
# For Windows users
$env:PATH = "$env:USERPROFILE\.cargo\bin;$env:PATH"
npm run tauri dev
```

**Note**: Building Tauri desktop app on Windows requires [Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/). The web version works perfectly without this!

#### Build for Production

**Web Version (Recommended)**:
```bash
npm run build
```
Output in `dist/` folder. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for deployment options.

**Desktop App**:
```bash
npm run tauri build
```
Requires Visual C++ Build Tools installed.

## Deployment

The app is built and ready to deploy! Choose your platform:

- **Vercel** (Recommended): `npx vercel`
- **Netlify**: `npx netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist`
- **Local Testing**: `npx serve dist -p 3000`

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions.

## How to Use

1. **Launch the app** - Click the "Push to Talk" button
2. **Grant microphone permission** when prompted
3. **Click and speak** - The button will turn red while recording
4. **Click again to stop** - The app will process your speech
5. **View transcription** - Your text appears below
6. **Copy or clear** - Use the action buttons as needed

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **Desktop Framework**: Tauri (Rust)
- **Speech-to-Text**: Deepgram API (Nova-2 model)
- **Audio Capture**: Web Audio API

## Troubleshooting

### Microphone Not Working

- Ensure you've granted microphone permissions to the app
- Check if your microphone is properly connected
- Try restarting the application

### API Errors

- Verify your Deepgram API key is correct in `.env`
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure you haven't exceeded Deepgram's free tier limits

### Build Errors

- Make sure Rust is properly installed: `rustc --version`
- Update Rust: `rustup update`
- Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

## Known Limitations

- Requires internet connection for Deepgram API
- Recording quality depends on microphone hardware
- Free tier has usage limits (check Deepgram pricing)

## Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Tauri over Electron**: Chosen for smaller bundle size and better performance
2. **Deepgram API**: Selected for high accuracy and low latency transcription
3. **WebM Audio Format**: Used for browser compatibility and good compression

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Hotkey support for push-to-talk
- [ ] Multiple language support
- [ ] Local transcription option (offline mode)
- [ ] Text export to file
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut to insert text into active window

## Recommended IDE Setup
