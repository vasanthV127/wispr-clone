## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Desktop App - Microphone Permission
The error you saw is normal on first run. To fix:
1. Click "Push to Talk"
2. Windows will ask for microphone permission
3. Click "Allow"
4. Recording will work!

### If Video Recording Fails
Just use the live web version for the demo - it's actually easier to show!
