## 🎯 Recommendation:

**Option A: Go for Desktop Build (Ambitious)**
- Install Visual C++ Build Tools
- Build desktop app
- Total time: 2-3 hours
- Risk: Might encounter build errors

**Option B: Skip Desktop Build (Safe)**
- Focus on perfect demo video
- You already have live web app
- Web version works perfectly
- Less risk, still excellent submission

**My Honest Opinion:**
With your live deployment + 3 bonus features, you're already in the top tier.  
Desktop build is nice but NOT critical for standing out.  
Focus on an EXCELLENT demo video instead!

## 🚀 YOU'RE DOING AMAZING!

You now have:
- ✅ Working app
- ✅ Live demo
