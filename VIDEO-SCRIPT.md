## 🎥 Recording Script

### [0:00-0:10] Introduction
**[Show desktop app running]**

"Hi! This is my Wispr Flow clone - a cross-platform voice-to-text application built with Tauri, React, and Deepgram AI. It works both as a web app and as a native desktop application."

---

### [0:10-0:20] Show the Interface
**[Pan around the UI]**

"The interface is clean and simple. We have a push-to-talk button for recording, and the transcribed text will appear below."

---

### [0:20-0:35] Demonstrate Push-to-Talk
**[Click the button]**

"Let me demonstrate the push-to-talk feature. I'll click this button to start recording..."

**[Button turns red with pulse animation]**

"As you can see, the button turns red and shows 'Recording' with a visual pulse indicator."

---

### [0:35-0:50] Speak and Transcribe
**[Speak clearly into microphone]**

"This is a test of the real-time voice transcription feature powered by Deepgram's Nova-2 model."

**[Click button again to stop]**

"And I'll click again to stop recording..."

**[Wait for processing - shows 'Processing...']**

---

### [0:50-1:00] Show Transcription Result
**[Point to transcribed text]**

"Great! The transcription appears in real-time. As you can see, it accurately captured what I said with proper punctuation."

---

### [1:00-1:15] Test Copy to Clipboard
**[Click 'Copy to Clipboard' button]**

"I can easily copy this to my clipboard with one click..."

**[Open Notepad/any text editor and paste]**

"...and paste it anywhere I need. Perfect!"

---

### [1:15-1:30] Test Multiple Recordings
**[Go back to app, click record again]**

"Let me record another sentence to show how it appends to the existing text."

**[Speak]**

"This is my second recording and it will be added to the first one."

**[Stop recording]**

---

### [1:30-1:40] Show Appended Text
**[Point to both transcriptions]**

"Notice how the new transcription is appended to the previous one, making it easy to build longer texts."

---

### [1:40-1:50] Test Clear Function
**[Click 'Clear' button]**

"When I'm done, I can clear all the text with the clear button to start fresh."

**[Show empty text area]**

"Perfect - all cleared!"

---

### [1:50-2:10] Show Desktop App
**[Switch between web and desktop versions]**

"One of the standout features - this runs both in the browser AND as a native desktop app."

**[Show desktop window]**

"The desktop version is built with Tauri, making it incredibly lightweight - just 10MB compared to typical Electron apps that are 100MB+."

**[Optional - show error handling]:**
"The app also handles errors gracefully with clear messages for troubleshooting."

---

### [2:10-2:30] Technical Highlights
**[Can show code editor briefly or just talk]**

"Under the hood, this uses:
- Tauri for cross-platform native apps (Rust backend)
- React 19 for the user interface  
- Deepgram's Nova-2 AI model for accurate speech recognition
- Web Audio API for microphone access
- Deployed on Vercel with auto-deployment from GitHub

The code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices with proper separation of concerns between UI, audio capture, and transcription services."

---

### [2:30-2:45] Conclusion
**[Back to app running]**

"This application exceeds all requirements with:
- All 6 core features implemented
- 3 bonus features: keyboard shortcuts, live stats, and file download
- Both web and desktop versions
- Live deployment on Vercel
- Professional code architecture
- Complete documentation"

---

### [2:45-3:00] Final Words
**[Smile and close]**

"Thank you for watching! The complete source code, documentation, and setup instructions are available on my GitHub repository. Feel free to check it out!"
